# DSAI-Journal
This is my  journal for the Data Science & AI program at Leiden University. Here Iâ€™m collecting all my notes from every course, along with the resources, tips, and examples that actually helped me understand things.
The idea is pretty simple: instead of keeping everything scattered (slides, books, random YouTube videos, StackOverflow links) I put it all here in one place.
